Abstract
========

Many mechanical systems can be used for computation. One of interest that occurs
in introductory physics courses is that of systems of pulleys. This text
investigates the velocity ratios possible using systems of pulleys, and how they
can be used for more complex computation if only displacements are dealt with.

Velocity Ratio Pulley Systems
=============================

The velocity ratio $R = {v_{out}}/{v_{in}}$ can be used as a means of
representing numbers relatively in a mechanical system of pulleys. For a block
and tackle configuration of pulleys, $R = {1}/{k}, k \in \mathbb{Z^+}$. This is
the case because a free pulley can be arranged to have $k$ strings coming off of
it, with one string heading back to the input. Symmetrically, by swapping the
input and output, the inverted block and tackle configuration of pulleys can be
made to have $R = k, k \in \mathbb{Z^+}$. Because the output of one block and
tackle pulley configuration can be attached to the input of another,
multiplication of two numbers $R_1$ and $R_2$ can be achieved by interpreting
the velocity ratios $R$ as numbers. Thus, any velocity ratio $R \in \mathbb{Q}$
can be achieved.

Displacement Pulley Systems
===========================

If displacement at the output is used to represent numbers instead of the
velocity ratio, then more numbers may be constructed. By arranging pieces of
string under tension, a right triangle with both sides having length $s$ has
hypotenuse $\sqrt{2s^2} = s\sqrt{2}$. By dividing this quantity by $s$ by
previous pulley constructions, a segment of string having length $\sqrt{2}$ can
be created. Construct another right triangle with sides $1$ and $\sqrt{2}$. This
has hypotenuse $\sqrt{3}$. Generally, a triangle of sides $1$ and $\sqrt{k}$ has
hypotenuse $\sqrt{k+1}$. Thus by representing numbers in this pulley system as
displacements, combined with the pulley operations of addition and
multiplication, arbitrary displacements $D$ can be created, where $D$ lies
within the algebraic numbers $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$.
