A collection of quick reference documents or pretty pictures that are usually
visible on my wall.

- [Kit resistor combinations](pub/kit_resistors.pdf) is a table of all
	combinations of an *E3* value resistor kit, since combinations are necessary
	with only the *E3* values.

- [Two port networks](pub/twoport.pdf) is a display of two port networks. I
	don't actually like using two port networks for things like modeling BJTs,
	but the collection of similar circuits is pretty to look at.
