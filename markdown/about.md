[This website][] was created by Alex Striff *(jfjhh)*. You can email him
[here][], especially if there is something wrong with the site. If you email
him, you have the option of using his [PGP Key][] to do so, though nobody knows
what [PGP][] even [is][]. He also has a [GitHub Page][] that you can stare at.
Most of his projects are hosted there. He started attending [Reed College][] in
2017 to pursue physics, but he is also interested in the broader natural
sciences, electronics, though also in *real* computer "science" that is closer
to the $\lambda$-calculus than to the silicon, and foundational branches of
mathematics such as group theory, category theory or homotopy type theory in
addition to the standard fare of calculus, linear algebra, discrete mathematics,
and others. He knows some French in addition to his native English, and a lot of
programming, scripting, or markup languages in addition to his native English,
from the obvious HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to the mainstream Java, C, C++,
Python, Ruby, to the build-oriented POSIX Shell Script, GNU Makefile, CMake
file, Automake, Autoconf, and M4, and to even the obscure x86 Assembly, R,
Haskell, Scheme, Common Lisp, BNF, ABNF, and likely others. That [Github Page][]
*is* available for hire after all.
